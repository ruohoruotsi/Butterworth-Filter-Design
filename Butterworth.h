/*
 
 This file is part of Butterworth Filter Design, a pair C++ classes and an
 accompanying suite of unit tests for designing high order Butterworth IIR &
 EQ filters using the bilinear transform.
 The generated filter coefficients are split out into cascaded biquad sections,
 for easy use in your garden variety biquad or second-order section (SOS).
